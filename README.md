# Discord-Bot
This is a Node.js bot for Discord that is powered by [discord.js][1]

[1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js

Setup
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have Node.js installed (version 6.0.0+), you want to go ahead and configure your settings for the bot.  To do this, copy `config-example.js` -> `config.js`.  Then, go ahead and enter the various configuration options you'd like to use.

After setting up `config.js`, you want to install the required dependencies.  You can do this by running `npm install`.

When your dependencies are done installing, you can finally start the bot using `node bot.js`

Congradulations, you have setup the bot!
